Customer Support Case Type Classification Project
Overview: Customer support centers receive a variety of cases from customers, ranging from technical issues and billing inquiries to general queries. Efficiently classifying these cases is essential for ensuring that support teams can quickly respond and resolve issues, leading to improved customer satisfaction and streamlined support processes. This project focuses on building an automated system that can classify customer support cases based on certain features such as the message length and the response time of the support team. The goal is to develop a model that can automatically categorize cases into distinct types to expedite case handling.Customer Support Case Type Classification Project

Key Features of the Dataset:
Message Length: This refers to the number of characters in the customer's message. It may provide insights into the complexity or level of detail in the query.

Response Time: The amount of time it takes for the support team to respond to a customer's query. This could indicate the urgency or difficulty of addressing the issue.

Case Type: The target variable that denotes the category of the customer support case. The types are:

Billing: Queries related to payments, invoices, or account charges.

Technical: Issues involving technical problems, such as software bugs or hardware malfunctions.

General Queries: Other types of inquiries that do not fall under the billing or technical categories, such as requests for information or general feedback.

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to build an automated system capable of classifying customer support cases into one of the three categories: Billing, Technical, and General Queries. By doing so, the support team can quickly and efficiently route cases to the appropriate departments, improving the speed and accuracy of issue resolution.

Importance of Automated Classification:
Improved Efficiency: Automation ensures that each case is classified and handled by the appropriate support team with minimal human intervention, reducing delays.

Faster Resolution Times: By accurately classifying cases, customers receive quicker responses to their issues, enhancing customer satisfaction.

Resource Optimization: Support teams can allocate resources more effectively by prioritizing cases based on their category and urgency.

How This Project Helps:
Through analysis of historical support cases, including their message length and response time, this project helps identify patterns that can be used to predict the type of a new customer support case. The aim is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques such as Random Forest or Logistic Regression, trained on these features to automate case classification.

By implementing this system, customer support centers can:

Reduce manual triaging of support cases.

Ensure that each case is quickly assigned to the right team, allowing for faster resolution.

Improve overall customer experience through faster response times and more accurate support.
